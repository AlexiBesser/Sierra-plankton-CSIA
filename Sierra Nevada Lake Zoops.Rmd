# Project Overview
Compound specific isotope analysis of individual amino acids (CSIA-AA) is a new and exciting tool in the study of trophic ecology and animal nutrition. CSIA-AA are not constrained by the same spatiotemporal variability and high fractionation effects observed in stable isotope analyses (SIA) of bulk tissues (carbons + lipids + proteins). Therefore, CSIA-AA represent a sea change in our ability to understand food webs and organism trophic interactions.  

Certain amino acids can only be produced by primary producers (bacteria, algae, plants, fungi). These de novo synthesized amino acids, termed 'essential amino acids,' must be gained by animals through feeding/dietary means. Essential amino acids are passed from producers to consumers with limited fractionation or transamination, making them an ideal tool to examine the sources of carbon in consumers. Moreover, essential amino acids differ in their isotope signatures due to the biochemical pathways found in different groups of producers (i.e., fungi, bacteria, microalgae, C3/C4/CAM plants), allowing producers signatures to be mapped with high resolution. By using multiple essential amino acids as a multivariate trait, an essential amino acid fingerprint can be used to identify the source of amino acids in consumers and the contributions and identify of producers in diets.

The role of terrestrial carbon in aquatic has been viewed as a resource, a subsidy, and a determent to aquatic consumers and ecosystems. For instance, zooplankton prefer the high fatty acid content of microalgae, which is a vital source for zooplankton nutrition. However, terrestrial carbon (leaves and detritus) into lakes leads to browning and a decrease in microalgae productivity as light is attenuated. In this case, allochthonous nutrition limits primary production but can be an important resource for consumers that are able to utilize the abundant (although low quality) nutritional source.

Here, we used CSIA-AA to ask whether zooplankton in high elevation (largely ologotrophic) alpine lakes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains obtain their essential amino acids from in-water producers (particulate organic matter of microalgae origin) or from terrestrial C3 plants (sedges, pines, broadleaf deciduous trees). We sampled 6 lakes and 1 dystrophic pond in the Eastern Sierra Nevadas across an elevation gradient (2500-3200m) and measured environmental conditions (temperature, pH, DOC, TN, TP, chlorophyll a), measuring AA-carbon isotope values in producers and plankton consumers picked to individual species as well as size-fractioned plankton.

## Data  
Load in the data and pull out the essential amino acids, then subset by sample type.  
```{r load, eval =FALSE}

###### this comes from another script to correct data #####
###### the file and script to read in are currently NOT in repo ### 
SNL.d13C.aa <- tbl13CSamp[substr(tbl13CSamp$SampleID,1,4)=="SNL-",]

#Round AA d13C values to one digit
library(dplyr)
SNL.d13C.aa <- SNL.d13C.aa %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits = 1)

#Write csv file - d13C for all AA - UNM standard
write.csv(SNL.d13C.aa, "data/Sierra Nevada Lakes AA d13C Data UNM standard.csv")

```

Pull in the standardized CSIA data and the ESS-AA, excluding Lysine
```{r essAA}
SNL.d13C.aa<- read.csv("data/Sierra Nevada Lakes AA d13C Data UNM standard.csv")


#Pull out just the essential AA values (excluding Lys)
SNL.ess <- data.frame(SNL.d13C.aa$SampleID, SNL.d13C.aa$Ile13C, SNL.d13C.aa$Leu13C, SNL.d13C.aa$Phe13C, SNL.d13C.aa$Thr13C, SNL.d13C.aa$Val13C)

#Rename columns
colnames(SNL.ess) <- c("ID", "Ile", "Leu", "Phe", "Thr", "Val")
SNL.ess$ID <- as.character(SNL.ess$ID)

#Subset terrestrial plants

#Add a column for group
plants$Group <- "Terrestrial Plants"

#Subset POM
pom <- SNL.ess[substr(SNL.ess$ID,1,8)=="SNL-POM-",]
#Add a column for group

#Write csv file - primary producer d13C for just ess AA - UNM standard
prod <- rbind(plants, pom)
write.csv(prod, "output/SNL_producers_ess_AA_data.csv")

#Subset zooplankton
zoops <- SNL.ess[substr(SNL.ess$ID,1,9)=="SNL-ZOOP-",]

#Pull in zooplankton metadata
zoops_meta <- read.csv("data/Zoops_Meta.csv")
zoops <- merge.data.frame(zoops_meta, zoops, by.x = "ID", by.y = "ID")

#Write csv file - zooplankton d13C for just ess AA - UNM standard

## LDA - Primary Producers
```{r}
#Run an LDA with a jackknifing model fit to look at error rate
#'CV = TRUE' makes the LDA run a jackknifed - leave one out - model fit
All.lda <- lda(Group ~ Ile + Leu + Phe + Thr + Val, data = prod, CV = TRUE)

#Create a table which compares the classification from the LDA model to the actual classification
All.reclass <- table(prod$Group, All.lda$class)

#Total percent of samples correctly classified is the sum of the diagonal of this table
sum(diag(prop.table(All.reclass)))

#Percent of each producer group correctly reclassified
diag(prop.table(All.reclass, 1))

#Create a training LDA function from the library data
#Note - you can't use the 'All.lda' object above because the 'CV = TRUE' command was used to create it, and for some reason this won't work with the predict() function
All.train <- lda(Group~ Ile + Leu + Phe + Thr + Val, data = prod)
All.train

#Write a csv file for the coefficients of LD1
lda.info <- as.data.frame(All.train$scaling)

#Create a data frame with these LDA coordinates
